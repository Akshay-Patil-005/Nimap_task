As Per the Requirements.

Consider the following scenario where we have 3 entities in our system.

1. User

2. Client

3. Project



We have the number of users registered in our system.

You can use Djangoâ€™s default admin template to create/register users but not other entities or you can make REST APIs for users as well if you want.

 
You have to perform the following tasks :

1. Register a client

2. Fetch clients info

3. Edit/Delete client info

4. Add new projects for a client and assign users to those projects.

5. Retrieve assigned projects to logged-in users.

 

Things to consider :

1. The system has many users.

2. The system has many clients.

3. A client can have many projects

4. A single project can be assigned to many users.
